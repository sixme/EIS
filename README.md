# EIS
This repository is part of my MsC being conducted at TU Delft. It contains the EIS (Environment Interface Standard) used to communicate 'MyAgent' with the environment (the user) via a shell.

### The EIS is completed, however, for confidentiality issues the code for the connection with the NAO robot is not available.
